## Docker container for RServe

Repository to demonstrate how to use R from Java. There are generally two ways of interfacing with R from Java. One of them is to run Rserve and call it from Java. Docker is a great solution for running an instance of Rserve without hassle.

## Usage
- Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) if you don't have it yet.
- Run Rserve. This command will pull tilayealemu/Rserve image and run it locally, exposing the default Rserve port 6311.
```bash
docker run -p6311:6311 tilayealemu/dockerr
```
- You're now ready to run R scripts from Java. Here is an example that defines multiply function, calls it and prints the result. You can find the full source code in the sample directory.
```java
import org.rosuda.REngine.REXP;
import org.rosuda.REngine.REXPMismatchException;
import org.rosuda.REngine.Rserve.RConnection;
import org.rosuda.REngine.Rserve.RserveException;
...
RConnection connection = new RConnection("127.0.0.1", 6311);
connection.eval("multiply=function(a,b){return(a*b)}");
REXP result = connection.eval("multiply(4,5)");
System.out.println("Result: " + result.asDouble());
```

## Troubleshoot
- You can see this if Rserve is not running. Check that it's running and that port 6311 is open.

```Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.rosuda.REngine.REngineException.<init>(Lorg/rosuda/REngine/REngine;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/Throwable;```
